# Lighthouse Design System

Lighthouse is [Harbor School](https://link.harbor.school/lighthouse-package-framer)’s open-source design system for its integrated design & development workflow.

## Documentation

Lighthouse Design System provides a [documentation site](https://lighthouse.harbor.school) for more details.

## Theme Switcher

**Theme Switcher** component is used to defining themes for targeted Framer canvas. Drop it to a specific page of Framer, and it applies with theme tokens to nearby components.

Theme Switcher gives a Light/Dark theme. If you want to use a custom theme, change the theme property to "Custom," and upload the .json format file to Theme Switcher to get the components' custom appearance.

Custom Theme could be made using the [Theme Generator](https://lighthouse.harbor.school/theme/theme-generator/) to make a custom theme of the system.

## Overriding Component Properties

You can override all properties of components. The list of properties could be found on the [documentation site](https://lighthouse.harbor.school).
