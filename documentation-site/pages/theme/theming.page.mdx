In this section, the Basic token structure of the theme is described below.

Theme data is a simple .json format, and each token could be used one by one as a property of the JSON file.

## Colors

Colors in Lighthouse has three kinds of tokens. Scale / Foundational / Semantic tokens are that. The kinds of tokens are linked rigidly for system balances of strictness and flexibility.
<br/>

It is fully customizable (edit, remove, add) using the [Theme Generator](/theme/theme-generator).

### Color Scale

The color scale is a base palette of the color system
<br/>

Lighthouse used [ColorBox](https://colorbox.io/) from Kevyn Arnott to generate the default color scale. It enables considering hue, saturation, brightness in an acceptable human manner at the same time.

### Foundational Colors

The color foundation is the base of the system UI colors.

It includes five kinds that are mostly used in the standard UI system.
<br/>

*primary / negative / warning / positive / mono*
<br/>

(These tokens are only composed of Color Scale.)

### Semantic Colors

Color semantic are colors of application UI that has semantic names.
<br/>

(These tokens are only composed of Color Scale or Foundational Colors.)

## Lighting

Lightings are uses for box-shadows and overlay to highlight which element could be focused more on the user.

## Typography

You can add your custom typography styles
<br/>

(Font files are not included in the system. Include it manually in your app.)

## Sizings

Essential sizing scales for spacings.

## Breakpoints

Breakpoints are the point for responding to user's device sizes.

## Z-Index

Z-Indexes are used to define layer orders of elements.
