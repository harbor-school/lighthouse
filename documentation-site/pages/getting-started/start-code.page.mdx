# Getting Started


## Start Code

Lighthouse initially starts as a React UI Library.

You can use the pure power of it as an npm package like others.

## Installing Lighthouse

Install Lighthouse package with peer dependencies.

```bash
yarn add @harborschool/lighthouse styletron-engine-atomic styletron-react framer-motion
```

if you use TypeScript add external TypeScript declarations:

```bash
yarn add @types/styletron-standard @types/styletron-react @types/styletron-engine-atomic
```

## Adding Lighthouse to Your Application

In order to use Lighthouse, you need to do a small setup and wrap the root of your application with StyletronProvider and LighthouseProvider components:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import { Client as Styletron } from "styletron-engine-atomic";
import { Provider as StyletronProvider } from "styletron-react";
import { LightTheme, LighthouseProvider } from "@harborschool/lighthouse";
import * as System from "@harborschool/lighthouse";

const engine = new Styletron();
function App() {
  return (
    <StyletronProvider value={engine}>
      <LighthouseProvider theme={LightTheme}>
        <System.Button>Hello Lighthouse</System.Button>
      </LighthouseProvider>
    </StyletronProvider>
  );
}

const rootElement = document.getElementById("root");
ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>,
  rootElement
);
```
